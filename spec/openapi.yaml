    This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of OpenAPI specification
    # Introduction
    This specification is intended to to be a good starting point for describing your API in 
    [OpenAPI/Swagger format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).
    It also demonstrates features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) tool and 
    [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation engine. So beyond the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few 
    [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

    # OpenAPI Specification
    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which
    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source
    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can 
    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what
    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.
